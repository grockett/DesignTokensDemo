# 1. Adopt ADR for Design System

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Creating and maintaining a Design System involves making many decisions and often gaining consensus from multiple parties. The current Design System, being an inherited system, contains lots of decisions for which the rationale isn't a clear fit for OFH's use cases, having no record of how the decisions were arrived at makes reasoning about them difficult.

## Decision
Adopt an ADR format for recording decisions relating to the architecture of the Design System.

+ Onboarding of new Design System team members becomes easier when the decisions that led to it's structure are accessible.

+ Responding to organisational change becomes smoother, for example when team structures or project needs demand a change in ownership. New owners can quickly get up to speed with how and why the system evolved in the way it did.

+ Retrospectively inferring decisions that led to the Design System's current structure gives us a starting point for rationalising change and improvement.

- Extra process sometimes annoys people

- High initial load as we retrospectively infer why decisions were made
